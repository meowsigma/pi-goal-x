# pi-goal

`pi-goal` is a long-running goal extension for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent). It gives the agent a durable objective, a visible lifecycle, and schema-gated tools for drafting, executing, pausing, resuming, and completing work.

The extension is designed around one rule: **the user owns intent; the agent executes only after the goal is explicit and confirmed**.

## What it provides

- **Two goal styles**: regular goals for open-ended work, and Sisyphus goals for patient ordered execution.
- **Draft-before-run flow**: `/goal-set` and `/goal-sisyphus` start a drafting conversation before any work begins.
- **Confirm-before-commit**: the agent must call `propose_goal_draft`; the user confirms or keeps chatting.
- **Full goal visibility**: after confirmation, the final objective is printed back into the conversation in full.
- **Multiple open goals**: `.pi/goals/` may hold several active goal files at once; each pi session focuses exactly one goal at a time.
- **Session-local focus**: the focused goal id is stored as a branch-local session entry, not in goal markdown metadata.
- **Auto-continue loop**: confirmed goals can continue across turns until completion, pause, budget limit, abort, or user interruption.
- **Schema gates**: unsafe lifecycle transitions are rejected by tool validators, not just prompts.
- **Sisyphus as a light variant**: Sisyphus shares the normal lifecycle/tools and differs only in prompt style and completion standard.
- **Pause/resume/abort/clear lifecycle**: goals can be paused by the user, paused by the agent when blocked, resumed, completed from pause, aborted, or archived.
- **Disk-backed state**: active and archived goals are stored under `.pi/goals/`.
- **Lightweight built-in questionnaire tools**: `goal_question` and `goal_questionnaire` let the agent ask structured drafting questions without depending on another package.
- **Above-editor status widget**: pi shows the current goal, status, budget, progress, and active file path while work is running.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@capyup/pi-goal
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
pi install .
```

Try once without installing:

```bash
pi -e .
```

## Quick start

### Regular goal

```text
/goal-set add structured logging to the auth module
```

Flow:

1. The agent asks at least one concrete question about success criteria, constraints, boundaries, priorities, or blocker handling.
2. The agent calls `propose_goal_draft` with a concrete objective after incorporating the answer.
3. pi shows a full plain-text confirmation report.
4. If confirmed, the full finalized goal is printed into the conversation and written to `.pi/goals/`.
5. The new goal becomes this session's focus. Existing open goals remain in `.pi/goals/` and can be selected later with `/goal-focus`.
6. The agent works only on the focused goal until it calls `update_goal(status="complete")`, pauses, aborts, hits a budget/cap, or the user interrupts.

### Sisyphus goal

```text
/goal-sisyphus Refactor the auth flow: 1) extract token validation. 2) wire it into login. 3) update tests.
```

Sisyphus mode is for patient ordered execution. It uses the same lifecycle and tools as a regular goal; the difference is the prompt style and completion standard: preserve the user's order, do not rush, do not invent preflight/reconnaissance steps, and stop to ask when blocked.

## User commands

```text
/goal-set <topic>       Start drafting a regular goal
/goal-sisyphus <topic>  Start drafting a Sisyphus-style goal
/goal-status            Show focused goal state
/goal-list              List all open goals in .pi/goals/
/goal-focus             Choose this session's focused goal
/goal-tweak <change>    Draft a revision to the focused active/paused goal
/goal-pause             Pause the focused active goal
/goal-resume            Resume a paused goal
/goal-budget <n|none>   Raise, set, or remove the focused goal's token budget
/goal-settings          Configure pi-goal settings, including auditor model settings
/goal-abort             Abort/archive the focused goal or cancel drafting
/goal-clear             Archive the focused goal or cancel drafting
```

Pressing `Esc` or aborting an active run pauses the goal so it does not remain falsely active.

## Multiple open goals and focus

`pi-goal` separates durable goals from session focus:

- **Goal pool**: every open goal is an `active_goal_*.md` file under `.pi/goals/`.
- **Focused goal**: the current pi session has one focused goal id stored in a `pi-goal-focus` custom session entry.
- **No focus in markdown**: goal files describe the goal itself; they do not record which session is focused on them.
- **Branch-local focus**: because focus is reconstructed from the current session branch, `/tree` navigation can restore a different focus for a different branch.
- **One continuation chain**: auto-continue only schedules work for the focused goal in the current session.

Creating a goal with `/goal-set` or `/goal-sisyphus` no longer clears other open goals. It creates a new active goal file and focuses it. Use `/goal-list` to inspect open goals and `/goal-focus` to switch the session focus. If the latest focus entry explicitly clears focus, or points at a missing/stale goal, a remaining single open goal is not auto-focused; single-open auto-focus only happens when no focus entry exists at all. If multiple open goals exist and the session has no valid focus, `/goal-resume`, `/goal-clear`, `/goal-abort`, `/goal-pause`, `/goal-tweak`, and `/goal-budget` ask the user to choose a goal instead of acting on all of them.

## Agent tools

The extension exposes tools only when they make sense for the current lifecycle phase.

| Tool | Visible when | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `goal_question` | drafting / tweak drafting | Ask one focused user question |
| `goal_questionnaire` | drafting / tweak drafting | Ask multiple structured questions |
| `get_goal` | always | Read the focused goal state; mentions other open goals when present |
| `propose_goal_draft` | goal drafting only | Submit a concrete draft for user confirmation |
| `apply_goal_tweak` | tweak drafting only | Submit a revision to an existing goal |
| `update_goal` | focused active or paused goal | Mark the focused goal complete when all requirements are satisfied |
| `pause_goal` | focused active/budget-limited goal | Pause the focused goal because of a real blocker |
| `abort_goal` | focused active, budget-limited, or paused goal | Abort/archive an obsolete, impossible, unsafe, or user-cancelled focused goal |
| `step_complete` | hidden / legacy | Compatibility no-op; Sisyphus no longer requires a step counter |
| `create_goal` | hidden | Direct calls are rejected; normal creation goes through `propose_goal_draft` |

## Drafting behavior

During `/goal-set`, `/goal-sisyphus`, or `/goal-tweak`, the agent is in an interview phase. For `/goal-set` and `/goal-sisyphus`, the agent must ask at least one concrete grill-me style question before `propose_goal_draft`; the B0 question gate rejects direct proposals. Prefer `goal_question` with a recommended answer for the first decision branch; use `goal_questionnaire` only for tightly related choices. Plain assistant text does not count as the required question. Workhorse tools stay registered so they can be restored immediately after confirmation, but drafting-time tool calls are blocked by the runtime gate.

Allowed during goal drafting:

- `goal_question`
- `goal_questionnaire`
- `get_goal`
- `propose_goal_draft`

Blocked during goal drafting:

- shell/file/search tools such as `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`
- lifecycle tools that would mutate execution state before the user confirms

When a draft is proposed, the confirmation UI shows a full plain-text report with draft details, the original topic, and the proposed goal. Draft prompts carry a `draftId`, and stale overlapping prompts are rejected if they try to commit after a newer draft starts. If the confirmation UI throws in interactive mode, creation fails closed and drafting remains active; it never auto-creates a goal. When a draft is confirmed, the tool result includes the full final objective, not a one-line summary, and normal work tools (`write`, `read`, `bash`, `edit`) are available for execution. This makes the confirmed contract visible in the conversation as well as on disk.

While drafting or tweak drafting is active, old goal execution is suspended: active-goal prompts, lifecycle mutation tools, accounting, and auto-continue checkpoints do not run for the previously focused goal.

## Budget recovery

When a focused goal reaches its token budget, it becomes `budgetLimited` and stops doing substantive work. The user can run `/goal-budget <tokens>` to set a higher budget, or `/goal-budget none` to remove the budget. If the new budget allows more work, the goal is reactivated, auto-continue is restored, and the per-goal continuation cap starts fresh.

## Completion behavior

Completion is also explicit and is checked by an independent pi auditor agent. The executor calls `update_goal` with its completion claim:

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "completionSummary": "What was completed and what evidence proves it."
}
```

Before archiving the goal, `update_goal` starts a separate pi agent in an isolated in-memory session. The auditor receives the objective, the executor's completion claim, and current goal metadata, then can inspect the workspace with read-only-oriented tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `bash`). It must end its report with exactly one marker:

- `<approved/>` archives the goal as complete.
- `<disapproved/>`, no marker, an error, or an abort rejects completion and leaves the goal open.

The auditor is semantic, not a paperwork checklist: it should reject scaffold-only, alpha, generated-template, proxy-metric, build-only, or weakly verified completions when the real user outcome is not satisfied.

By default the auditor uses the current/default pi model. Configure it interactively with `/goal-settings` -> `auditor`, then click `provider`, `model`, or `thinking_level` and type the value directly. The settings are saved to `.pi/goal-auditor.json`. You can also edit the file or override it with environment variables:

```json
{
  "provider": "fireworks",
  "model": "accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p6-turbo",
  "thinking_level": "high"
}
```

Environment variables `PI_GOAL_AUDITOR_PROVIDER`, `PI_GOAL_AUDITOR_MODEL`, and `PI_GOAL_AUDITOR_THINKING_LEVEL` take precedence over `/goal-settings`.

The completion result prints a full report into the conversation:

- `Goal complete.`
- optional completion summary / evidence supplied by the executor
- the auditor's approval report
- full current goal details, including objective, status, usage, budget, mode, and file path

Sisyphus goals use the same completion tool as regular goals. The stricter part is the prompt/criteria standard: the agent should only call completion after the whole ordered objective is actually satisfied and likely to survive independent auditing. A paused goal can also be completed directly when the agent already has enough evidence that every requirement is satisfied; it does not need a resume just to call `update_goal`.

## Schema gates

The shipped gates are intentionally small and mechanical.

| Gate | Prevents |
|---|---|
| Drafting tool whitelist | The agent doing repo reconnaissance before the user confirms a goal |
| Focus consistency | `/goal-set` accidentally becoming Sisyphus, or `/goal-sisyphus` becoming regular mode |
| Required drafting question | The agent directly agreeing to a goal without grilling the user on criteria or constraints |
| Confirm-before-commit | The agent silently creating or replacing a goal |
| Draft identity gate | A stale overlapping draft prompt creating or focusing a goal after a newer draft starts |
| Completion auditor gate | Archiving completion unless an independent pi auditor agent returns `<approved/>` |
| Abort gate | Aborting missing, stale, completed, or reasonless goals |
| Direct-create rejection | Hidden `create_goal` calls creating goals without the confirmation flow |
| Post-stop block | Continuing to call tools after `pause_goal`, `abort_goal`, `update_goal`, or `apply_goal_tweak` stops the turn |
| Auto-continue cap | Runaway continuation chains; cap counters are per-goal and reset on focus/lifecycle transitions |
| Abort pause | Active goals staying active after user abort / Ctrl-C |
| Disk reconciliation | External pause/archive/delete/status changes being ignored or overwritten by stale memory |
| Post-compaction reminder | Losing the active objective after session compaction |

## Files

```text
.pi/goals/active_goal_<timestamp>_<id>.md
.pi/goals/archived/goal_<timestamp>_<id>.md
```

Multiple `active_goal_*.md` files may exist simultaneously. This is the project-level open goal pool. The selected/focused goal is intentionally not stored in these files; focus lives in session custom state.

Each file contains:

1. extension-owned JSON metadata;
2. a user-editable `# Goal Prompt` section;
3. progress/status information.

Before commands, tools, and lifecycle hooks act on a focused goal, the runtime reconciles the focused record against the active goal file on disk. External archive/delete/status changes therefore win over stale in-memory state and cannot resurrect deleted active files. Prompt-body edits are still picked up from the `# Goal Prompt` section; focus is never stored in goal markdown.

Goal paths are constrained to `.pi/goals/` and `.pi/goals/archived/`; absolute paths, traversal, NUL bytes, symlinks, and unsafe metadata paths are rejected.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `PI_GOAL_MAX_AUTOCONTINUE_TURNS` | `30` | Hard cap for consecutive auto-continue turns, clamped to 1-1000 |
| `PI_GOAL_AUTO_CONFIRM` | unset | When `1`, auto-confirms drafts in headless/test contexts |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run check
npm pack --dry-run
```

The fast unit suite uses Node's built-in test runner and covers core parsing, drafting gates, lifecycle policy, abort policy, questionnaire formatting, centralized tool names, Sisyphus prompt-style behavior, completion reporting, and display helpers.

The experiment harness under `experiments/` runs full pi sessions against real model calls and mechanical rubrics.

```bash
cd experiments
bash harness/run.sh C1-vague-goal-set --count 3 --grade --no-smoke
```

```

## Design principles

- **User owns intent**: only the user starts, replaces, resumes, clears, or confirms goals; the agent may only pause, complete, or abort through schema-gated lifecycle tools with evidence/reason.
- **One commit path**: normal goal creation goes through drafting and confirmation.
- **Schema beats prompt walls**: recurring failure modes are handled by validators and tool-call interceptors.
- **Visible contracts**: confirmed goals and completion reports are printed fully into the conversation.
- **Lifecycle-shaped tool surface**: the agent sees only tools appropriate to the current phase.
- **Disk-backed continuity**: goal state survives context churn and can be audited from `.pi/goals/`.
- **Human-owned focus**: the agent may work on the focused goal, but only user commands/UI selection switch focus.

## Release policy

This repository can be validated locally with tests and packaging checks. Publishing a new npm version, pushing tags, and running `pi update` are explicit release steps and are not part of ordinary implementation goals unless requested.
