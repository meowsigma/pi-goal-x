## [0.18.3] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- **`addWrappedPipe` overflow in questionnaire** — `addWrappedPipe` in `goal-questionnaire.ts` was wrapping content at the full terminal width then prepending `│   ` (4 visible chars) to continuation lines, causing a terminal-width overflow crash (visibleWidth > safeWidth). Fixed by wrapping at `safeWidth - pipeWidth` so continuation lines with the pipe prefix stay within bounds.

- **Escape dialog header overflow** — the header text `"Audit interrupted by Escape  (continue = default)"` (53 visible chars) was not truncated to `innerWidth` at narrow terminal widths, causing overflow. Fixed by adding `truncateToWidth()` to the header line.

### Added

- **Overflow regression tests** (`tests/overflow-regression.test.ts`) — 20 new tests covering the `addWrappedPipe` fix at every width 20-120, with styled ANSI content, CJK wide characters, mixed content, single long words, exact wrap boundaries, whitespace handling, minimum width, and the exact crash scenario reproduction. Also covers `truncateToWidth` safety net at every width 1-120, with ANSI codes, and CJK chars.

- **Escape dialog overflow regression tests** (`tests/goal-escape-dialog.test.ts`) — parameterized tests at widths 50/60/70/80/90/109 asserting no rendered line exceeds the terminal width.

- **Widget overflow regression tests** (`tests/goal-widget.test.ts`) — parameterized widget safety net tests at widths 50/70/100/109/120, auditor progress crash regression, and unfocused widget with 38 open goals at width 109.

## [0.18.2] — 2026-05-29

### Changed

- **Co-proposal prompt guidance** — the drafting protocol in `goal-draft.ts` and the continuation prompt in `goal-prompts.ts` now instruct agents to include the task list in the `tasks` parameter of `propose_goal_draft` when the objective decomposes into milestones. The old guidance encouraging `propose_task_list` after goal confirmation has been removed.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **TUI crash guard** — pi-tui differential render no longer throws a fatal error when a line's visible width exceeds terminal width. Both the incremental render path and the full-redraw path now truncate overflowing lines with `truncateToWidth()` instead of crashing.
- **Widget safety net** — `GoalWidgetComponent.render()` post-processes every line and truncates any that exceeds the render width, defending against widget edge cases that could bypass per-line truncation.

### Added

- **Regression test** — `goal-widget.test.ts`: "GoalWidgetComponent safety net truncates any line exceeding width" asserts that rendering at width 50 with extreme-length content produces no line with `visibleWidth > 50`.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Hidden TUI debug mode** — Ctrl+Shift+X toggles a debug panel in the goal widget with raw goal field display, task tree summary, and legend. Ctrl+Shift+N creates/removes a test goal (writes to `.pi/goals/debug/`), Ctrl+Shift+T injects sample tasks, Ctrl+Shift+R starts a mock completion audit, and Ctrl+Shift+O opens the proposal confirmation dialog with a realistic proposal built from typed `GoalTask[]` objects through the real rendering pipeline.
- **`addWrappedPipe` helper** — pipe-prefixed (`│   `) lines that wrap now prepend `│   ` to every continuation line so wrapped text stays inside the ASCII box.
- **Task checkbox detection inside pipe sections** — `│   [x] t1: ...` lines are now properly detected as task checkboxes (not misinterpreted as key-value pairs) and render with per-status coloring inside the box.

### Changed

- **MAX_CONTEXT_LINES removal** — the 12-line truncation cap (`MAX_CONTEXT_LINES = 12`) is removed from `goal-questionnaire.ts`. The full proposal is now visible without truncation. Replaced `addContextWrapped` with `renderContextLines` that renders every line with per-line styling.
- **Enriched confirmation dialog** — `buildDraftConfirmationText` and `buildTweakConfirmationText` now emit `─── Section Name ───` markers that `renderContextLines` converts to full-width box-drawing borders (`┌─ Section Name padding─┐`). Task checkbox items get per-status coloring (`[x]` success green, `[ ]` warning yellow) with item titles in muted. Goal structure lines (`=== Goal ===`, `Objective:`, `Success criteria:`, `Boundaries:`, `Constraints:`, `Verification contract:`, `If blocked:`) are detected and styled as accent.
- **Pipe prefix for all objective content** — `buildDraftConfirmationText` and `buildTweakConfirmationText` now prefix every objective line with `│   ` (except lines already starting with `│`). Task checkbox lines and box-drawing borders inside the objective text now appear inside the ASCII box with consistent indentation.
- **Debug proposal task lines** — `renderDebugTaskLines` output in the debug Ctrl+Shift+O dialog is now prefixed with `│   ` to match the box layout.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`auditorEnabled` in questionnaire results** — `runGoalQuestionnaire` accepts an optional `auditorToggleInit` parameter and returns `auditorEnabled` in the result object. The confirmation dialog shows an "Auditor enabled/disabled" toggle indicator.
- **Per-goal `skipAuditor` field** — users can toggle the auditor off or on during goal confirmation. The choice is persisted on the goal record as `skipAuditor: true/false`. `complete_goal` skips the audit when `skipAuditor` is true on the target goal.
- **`isAuditorEnabledByDefault`** — new helper in `goal-settings.ts` that returns `true` unless `disabled: true` in the settings file or the `PI_GOAL_SETTINGS_FILE` env var.
- **Recursive duplicate task ID detection** — `checkDuplicateTaskIds` recursively validates all task IDs across the entire tree, preventing collisions between parent/subtask or sibling subtasks. Added to `validateTaskListProposal`.

### Changed

- **Task section appears first in draft context** — when both a goal objective and task list are proposed together, the task summary section appears FIRST in the context so it stays visible even when dialog context was previously capped.
- **`findTaskInTree` for task operations** — `validateTaskCompletion` and `validateTaskSkip` now use `findTaskInTree` instead of flat array lookup, enabling subtask tree operations.
- **Allow re-skipping already-skipped tasks** — `validateTaskSkip` no longer rejects already-skipped tasks, enabling toggle behavior.
- **Prompt wording cleanup** — `complete_goal` prompt guidance trimmed to remove redundant phrasing.
- **`complete_goal` status default** — `status=complete` is now the default when `status` parameter is omitted.
- **Audit flow with per-goal toggle** — when `skipAuditor` is true on a goal, the audit is skipped during `complete_goal` and a ledger event `audit_skipped` is appended.

### Fixed

- **Dialog failure fallback** — `showProposalDialog` catches errors in interactive mode and notifies the user; creation fails closed and never auto-creates a goal on dialog failure.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Escape-to-skip audit** — pressing Escape during an auditor run now aborts it and completes the goal immediately. The skip is recorded in the ledger with the reason `user_aborted` and auditor model metadata.
- **Audit progress widget** — the TUI shows a spinner, progress bar, step labels, current tool, and output lines while the auditor runs.
- **Audit abort detection** — the auditor detects aborts from both exceptions and `session.prompt()` returning after an abort signal, preventing stuck goals or ghost states.
- **COMPLETED status for Sisyphus** — completed Sisyphus goals now show a `COMPLETED` status label instead of a generic complete indicator.
- **Multi-session focus isolation** — goal focus data uses `goalFocusDetails` which includes the goal id and reason but not full balance data, preventing cross-session focus leakage.

### Fixed

- Fixed a merge bug where `propose_task_list` could produce a duplicate task list when called during a continuation.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **TUI Escape dialog during audit** — pressing Escape during a completion audit now shows a TUI confirmation dialog with two options: "Mark complete without audit" (bypasses auditor, marks goal complete immediately, agent receives structured message) and "Continue working" (skips audit, agent resumes). Replaces the old agent-mediated "Use goal_question" pattern.
- **`showEscapeDialog()` widget** — new `extensions/widgets/goal-escape-dialog.ts` with headless fallback.

### Changed

- **Goal prompt updated** — no longer instructs the agent to handle Escape via goal_question; describes the automatic TUI dialog instead.

## [0.15.1] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **Error messages referencing old file** — four user-facing messages in goal.ts no longer mention `.pi/goal-settings.json` (now say "settings").
- **README stale reference** — feature bullet now points at `.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json`.
- **Cleaned up orphaned file** — removed stale `.pi/goal-auditor.json` from disk.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-05-28

### Changed

- **Unified settings file** — all settings now live in a single `.pi/pi-goal-x-settings.json` file instead of two separate files. The unified file includes `disableTasks`, `disableContracts`, `subtaskDepth`, `provider`, `model`, `thinkingLevel`, and `disabled`. Clean break: old `.pi/goal-settings.json` and `.pi/goal-auditor.json` files are no longer read. Users must manually merge into the new file.
- **`loadGoalSettings` replaces `loadGoalAuditorConfig`** — the auditor now reads its config (provider, model, thinkingLevel, disabled) from the unified settings file via `loadGoalSettings()`. Old individual `loadGoalAuditorConfig`, `loadGoalAuditorFileConfig`, `saveGoalAuditorFileConfig`, `parseGoalAuditorConfig`, and `goalAuditorConfigPath()` functions removed from `goal-auditor.ts`.
- **Auditor env vars removed** — `PI_GOAL_AUDITOR_PROVIDER`, `PI_GOAL_AUDITOR_MODEL`, and `PI_GOAL_AUDITOR_THINKING_LEVEL` removed. Replaced with single `PI_GOAL_SETTINGS_FILE` env var that points at an alternative settings file path (relative to cwd or absolute). `PI_GOAL_DISABLE_TASKS` and `PI_GOAL_DISABLE_CONTRACTS` remain unchanged.
- **`/goal-settings` TUI updated** — now shows all settings in one list (disabled, provider, model, thinking_level, subtaskDepth, disableTasks, disableContracts) instead of a separate auditor-only sub-menu.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Unified goal + task acceptance** — `propose_goal_draft` accepts an optional `tasks` array parameter (full task list structure). The confirmation dialog shows the goal objective AND proposed task list together in a single rich TUI view with box-drawing panel (`┌─ TASKS ───┐`), section headers, and hierarchical indentation for subtasks. One confirmation (single enter press) creates both the goal and its task list atomically. Backward compatible: existing `propose_task_list` flow unchanged.
- **Recursive sub-task system** — `GoalTask` type gains optional `subtasks?: GoalTask[]` (recursive — sub-tasks are full task records with id, title, status, evidence, completedAt, verificationContract, and their own subtasks). `GoalSettings` gains `subtaskDepth?: number` field (default 1) in `.pi/goal-settings.json`. Depth validation/policy in `goal-policy.ts` enforces the limit at all proposal points. `lightweightSubtasks?: boolean` flag allows parent completion without child enforcement.
- **Depth-validated proposal flow** — subtask depth is validated BEFORE showing the confirmation dialog (moves pre-dialog to match `propose_task_list` behavior). `findSubtaskDepthViolation` and `validateTaskListProposal` used in both `propose_goal_draft` and `propose_task_list`.
- **Subtask enforcement on complete/skip** — `complete_task` rejects when a task has pending full subtasks (`checkSubtasksComplete`). `skip_task` cascades skip to all child subtasks (`skipAllSubtasks`). Both use `findTaskInTree`/`updateTaskInTree` helpers.
- **Hierarchical task display** — `taskListBlock` in prompts renders subtask trees with indentation via `renderTaskTree`. `buildTaskSummary`/`taskSummaryBlock` recursive. Widget (`goal-widget.ts`) counts subtasks recursively in `countFlatTasks` and finds next pending task via BFS `findFirstPending`.
- **Scroll fix for proposal dialogs** — `runGoalQuestionnaire` suppresses hardware cursor during dialog (`setShowHardwareCursor(false)`) to reduce ~60fps ANSI cursor-positioning writes that fight manual scrolling. Cursor restored on dialog close. Affects `propose_goal_draft`, `propose_task_list`, and all goal questionnaire dialogs.
- **E2E test coverage** — unified acceptance flow (goal creation + task list + subtasks + verification contract, disk round-trip verified) and scroll fix (headless dialog path exercises cursor operations).
- **Subtask normalization/roundtrip** — `normalizeTaskList`, `normalizeTaskItem`, and `cloneGoal` handle recursive subtask structures.
- **Subtask depth edge cases** — tests for depth below 1, non-integer, negative, and missing config file defaults.

### Changed

- **`subtaskDepth` default is 1** — one level of nesting (tasks → subtasks). Set via `.pi/goal-settings.json`. No config file means default 1.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Verification contract system** — goals and individual tasks can now define a `Verification contract:` section specifying what verification evidence is required before completion, enforced at both the prompt and tool level. Key properties:
  - **`Verification contract:` section** — when drafting a goal (via `propose_goal_draft` or `/goals-set`/`/sisyphus-set`), include a `Verification contract: <description>` section in the objective. The contract is extracted, stored on the goal record, and stripped from the visible objective text.
  - **`complete_goal` `verificationSummary`** — the old optional `testResults` parameter is replaced with a required `verificationSummary` (plain text). If the goal has a contract, the call is rejected unless `verificationSummary` is non-empty.
  - **Per-task contracts** — `propose_task_list` supports an optional `verificationContract` per task. `complete_task` gains an optional `verificationSummary` parameter; if the task has a contract, the summary is required.
  - **Prompt hardening** — `goalPrompt` and `continuationPrompt` include a VERIFICATION CONTRACT section instructing the agent to provide evidence against every contract item before calling `complete_goal`/`complete_task`.
  - **Auditor integration** — the auditor receives both the `verificationContract` and `verificationSummary` and cross-checks the agent's claims against real artifacts.
  - **Backward compatible** — goals/tasks without a `Verification contract:` section work exactly as before.

### Changed

- **`complete_goal` `testResults` removed** — fully replaced by `verificationSummary`. The deprecated `AuditorTestResults` interface is deleted; `AuditorVerificationEvidence` is the only interface used.
- **`buildGoalAuditorPrompt`** — now accepts `verificationSummary` instead of `testResults`; renders `<verification_summary>` and `<verification_contract>` blocks instead of `<test_evidence>`.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Task list system** — goals can now include a structured task list with `propose_task_list`, `complete_task`, and `skip_task` tools. Key properties:
  - **`propose_task_list`** — agent proposes a task list to the user via a Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog (mirrors `propose_goal_draft` pattern). Stops the turn. Merges with existing tasks, preserving statuses of matching IDs.
  - **`complete_task`** — marks a task complete with optional evidence (≤200 chars). Does **not** stop the turn, allowing the agent to continue work.
  - **`skip_task`** — marks a task skipped with a required reason. Does **not** stop the turn.
  - **`complete_goal` task gate** — when `blockCompletion: true` and pending tasks exist, `complete_goal` surfaces a soft guard warning rather than blocking outright. The gate is prompt-level only; the agent can still complete.
  - **Ledger events** — `task_list_set`, `task_complete`, `task_skipped` events recorded for full traceability.
  - **Serialization** — tasks persisted as `## Tasks` markdown section in goal files with `[x]`/`[ ]`/`[~]` markers, evidence, skip reasons, and `blockCompletion` comment.
  - **Prompt injection** — `taskListBlock` renders the active task list in both `goalPrompt` and `continuationPrompt`, including the TASK GATE warning when `blockCompletion` is enabled and pending tasks exist.
  - **Widget display** — heading shows `N/M tasks`; body shows the next pending task or `All tasks complete`.
  - **Auditor integration** — task summary block included in auditor prompt's `<goal_details>`.
  - **Optional** — goals without a `taskList` work exactly as before.

### Changed

- **`update_goal` renamed to `complete_goal`** — the completion tool is now named `complete_goal` to make its sole purpose unambiguous (marking the goal complete). The old name `update_goal` sounded generic and tempted agents to call it when work was unfinished. Prompt guidelines on the renamed tool were tightened: added "Do NOT call complete_goal if any work remains, even if substantial progress was made." All internal references, tests, prompts, and documentation updated.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-27

### Removed

- **`apply_goal_tweak` fully removed** — replaced with `propose_goal_tweak`, a confirmation-dialog tool that mirrors `propose_goal_draft` exactly. The old `apply_goal_tweak` (which applied tweaks inline without user confirmation) is deleted entirely from source: constant, registration, imports, handler, and all references. The `/goal-tweak` flow now shows a Confirm / Continue Chatting dialog before applying the revision.

### Added

- **`propose_goal_tweak` tool** — registered alongside `propose_goal_draft`, available exclusively during `/goal-tweak` drafting. Uses `showProposalDialog()` and `buildTweakConfirmationText()` to present the current objective, change summary, and proposed new objective. On Confirm: writes the new objective, clears drafting state, terminates the turn. On Continue Chatting: keeps drafting active for further refinement.
- **Comprehensive test coverage** — 13 new tests across three layers:
  - Unit: `buildTweakConfirmationText` renders normal/sisyphus modes and edge cases (3 tests).
  - Integration: tool registration, schema validation, rejection gates (no goal set, no `/goal-tweak` flow), prompt guidelines, renderCall/renderResult (11 tests).
  - E2E: real `pi --fork --mode json` test verifying `propose_goal_tweak` is rejected without an active `/goal-tweak` drafting flow (1 test).
  - Total test count: 143 tests (up from 131), all passing, TypeScript zero errors.

### Changed

- **`/goal-tweak` notification** now says "started a `/goal-tweak` flow on `{objective}` — I'll draft the change and propose the revision for you to Confirm." reflecting the new confirmation pattern.
- **`syncGoalTools()` and `fullGoalToolVisibility()`** — `propose_goal_tweak` shown during tweak drafting, hidden otherwise. Removed dead `draftingHiddenWorkTools` constant referencing `TWEAK_APPLY_TOOL_NAME`.
- **`goalTweakDraftingPrompt`** guides the agent to use `propose_goal_tweak` with confirmation dialog.
- **Test assertions updated** in `goal-tool-names.test.ts`, `goal-draft.test.ts`, `goal-update-objective.test.ts`, `goal-prompts.test.ts` — all references to `apply_goal_tweak` / `TWEAK_APPLY_TOOL_NAME` replaced with `propose_goal_tweak` / `PROPOSE_TWEAK_TOOL_NAME`.

---

## [0.10.2] — 2026-05-26

### Removed

- **`updatedObjective` from `update_goal`** — the goal objective can no longer be changed through `update_goal`. The parameter is removed from the schema, `additionalProperties: false` enforces strict rejection of unknown params, and the Phase 1 handler block that processed it is deleted. Objective changes now go exclusively through `apply_goal_tweak`, gated behind user-initiated `/goal-tweak`.

### Changed

- **`update_goal` error message** — simplified to: `"update_goal requires status=complete when marking a goal complete."` (no more branching on `updatedObjective` vs `status`).
- **Prompt guidelines** — `update_goal` prompt, `goalPrompt()`, and `continuationPrompt()` now state the goal objective is **immutable** and instruct the agent to ask the user to run `/goal-tweak` to revise it.
- **Test coverage** — old quick-sync/combined e2e tests replaced with schema-rejection and completion-only mock-pi tests. 2 new source-inspection unit tests verify `additionalProperties: false` and absence of `updatedObjective`.
- **Docs** — `README.md` rewritten ("Goal objective is immutable" section). Agent and chain docs (`e2e-test-runner.md`, `e2e-test.chain.md`) cleaned up.

---

## [0.10.1] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`testResults` attestation** — the executor can pass structured test evidence (`exitCode`, `suiteName`, `output`, `timestamp`) via `update_goal({testResults})`. The auditor receives it as a `<test_evidence>` block and is instructed to check it before re-running test suites, skipping redundant re-runs.
- **Full test coverage for `testResults`** — 6 unit tests covering rendering of full/minimal/null evidence blocks, multi-line output indentation, non-passing exit codes, and the checklist instruction to check evidence before re-running. 1 integration test verifying the handler accepts `testResults` without error.

### Changed

- **`buildGoalAuditorPrompt` checklist renumbering** — when `testResults` is provided, the checklist has 5 items (with step 3 about checking test evidence). Without it, the checklist has 4 items (no evidence step), ensuring step numbers always align.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Auditor progress visibility** — the auditor agent now has a `report_auditor_progress` tool to report its current step label (e.g. "Inspecting files...") and completion percentage at natural phase boundaries. The prompt instructs the model to use it at starting → inspecting → verifying → evaluating → reporting phases.
- **Progress bar widget** — when the auditor reports progress, the TUI widget renders a progress bar (`[████░░░░] 40%`) alongside the step label, giving the user a clear visual sense of completion.
- **Thinking phase awareness** — silent thinking phases (model reasoning without tool calls) are now detected via `thinking_start`/`thinking_end` stream events. The widget shows a distinct `⟡ thinking...` label with elapsed time and hides the Esc-to-skip hint during thinking.
- **`AuditorProgress` / `AuditorWidgetProgress` types** — extended with optional `label` and `percentage` fields for the progress tool and widget.
- **Widget tests for progress bar** — 5 new tests covering progress bar rendering at 0%/40%/100%, thinking phase display, step labels, undefined-percentage fallback, and narrow-width boundaries.

### Changed

- **`runGoalCompletionAuditor`** now passes the `report_auditor_progress` tool via `customTools` to the auditor agent session. Initial progress ("Starting audit..." / 0%) is emitted before the session starts. The `buildGoalAuditorPrompt` includes a "Progress reporting:" section with usage examples.
- **`renderAuditorWidgetLines`** — enhanced to display step label, progress bar, and thinking-phase icon/label. All existing display elements (spinner, tool name, output lines, Esc-to-skip) are preserved.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`update_goal({updatedObjective})`** — the agent can now sync the goal objective mid-flight when user requirements change, without completing the goal. The `status` parameter is now optional, allowing a pure objective-update call. This ensures the completion auditor evaluates against the latest requirements.
- **`validateGoalUpdate()`** extracted to `goal-policy.ts` — validates that the target goal is active/paused (rejects null or already-complete goals with specific messages). Used by the handler and testable independently.
- **Comprehensive e2e test suite**: 131 tests covering function-level integration (12 tests, 9-scenario matrix + 3 edge-case gates), mock-pi handler tests (4), file-validity/chain checks (6), and real `pi --fork --mode json` fork tests (3 scenarios).
- **Deterministic fork tests**: the `--mode json` fork test uses `--append-system-prompt` + `--tools get_goal,update_goal` to force the AI model to always call the required tools. Validates `tool_execution_start`/`tool_execution_end` JSON events with field-level assertions — no free-text AI output parsing.

### Changed

- **Goal archival deferred until after agent turn completes**: `update_goal` marks the goal complete in-memory and writes an active file (not archived). The `turn_end` lifecycle hook detects completed goals and archives them — after the agent has received the audit/skip result. Previously archival happened inline within the tool handler, before the agent could see the result.
- **`buildCompletionReport` supports `auditSkippedReason`**: skip notifications (disabled auditor, Esc abort) are now included in the tool output text.
- **`accountProgress` guard**: skips `reconcileFocusedGoalFromDisk` for completed goals, preventing lifecycle conflicts.

### Fixed

- **Combined path correct ordering**: when `updatedObjective` + `status: "complete"` are passed together, the objective update is applied first, then the normal completion+audit flow runs against the updated objective.
- **Completion gate timing**: `turnStoppedFor` and `terminate: true` are no longer set for pure objective-sync calls — only for actual completions.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Goal archival deferred until after agent turn completes**: previously, `update_goal` archived the goal file inline within the tool handler before the agent could see the audit result (or skip notification). Now the goal is marked complete in-memory and written as an active file (not archived) during `update_goal`, and archival happens at `turn_end` — after the agent has received the audit/skip result.

### Added

- **`buildCompletionReport` supports `auditSkippedReason`**: skip notifications (disabled auditor, Esc abort) are now included in the tool output text, ensuring the agent sees why the audit was skipped before the goal is archived.
- **Tests**: verify `writeActiveGoalFile` no longer auto-archives for complete status (deferred archival), and `buildCompletionReport` correctly handles `auditSkippedReason` with precedence over `auditorReport`.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-19

### Changed

- **Audit log messages clarified**: `extensions/goal.ts` — disabled/aborted audit messages now read naturally as goal completion notices ("Goal completed — auditor disabled in settings." / "Goal completed — auditor bypassed (user pressed Escape during audit).").

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **C19 iteration-frustration benchmark**: new spec under `specs/` exercising the proposal-refinement cycle with repeated rejection scenarios.
- Spec metadata files: `PRODUCT.md`, `TECH.md`, `MILESTONES.md` for the C19 benchmark.

### Changed

- **Normalized proposal-refinement cycle language**: `extensions/goal-draft.ts`, `extensions/goal-questionnaire.ts`, and `extensions/goal.ts` — consistent terminology across the drafting/refinement pipeline.
- Updated test assertions (`tests/goal-draft.test.ts`) to match the new language.

---

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- Gallery image metadata and placeholder screenshot for `pi.dev/packages`.

---

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Version metadata in package manifest after 0.7.0 release commit.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Goal auditor lifecycle** (`feat(auditor)`):
  - `disabled` config flag to turn off auditing entirely.
  - Real-time progress callbacks during audit execution.
  - `audit_skipped` event type recorded in the ledger with reason + auditor metadata.
- **Auditor progress widget**: live spinner, tool tracking, and skip hint in the TUI.
- **Auditor integration**:
  - Escape-key handling during audit (skip with Esc, prevents cascading goal pause).
  - `createSession` factory wiring `AbortSignal` to `session.abort()`.
  - Audit abort detection (both thrown and non-thrown `session.prompt` aborts).
  - Goal completes on audit abort instead of leaving an open state.

### Fixed

- Audit cancellation loop: `confirmBypassAuditor` param respected, skip-once with `triggerTurn` mirroring disabled-bypass path.
- Corrected Esc-to-skip widget message to reflect actual behavior.

### Tests

- Unit tests for disabled config, `audit_skipped` events, and widget skip hint.
- Abort-scenario tests for `runGoalCompletionAuditor`.
- Post-prompt abort detection test.
- Goal policy test validating completion report includes full auditor output.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
